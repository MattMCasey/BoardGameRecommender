# Board Game Recommender
### Based on data from BoardGameGeek.com

## Overview

In this project, I will use ratings from more than 100,000 BoardGameGeek.com users to create a board game recommender.

The recommender will use collaborative filtering, clustering and meta-data to recommend games that a user hasn’t yet rated but would likely enjoy -- and preferably could buy at the click of a link.

## What question or problem are you trying to solve?

Board games have become a thriving hobby, and board game companies have responded to the demand. At a recent board game trade show, publishers unveiled more than 400 new games and game products.

With so many titles hitting the shelves each year, it can be difficult for any but the most dedicated gamer to know what game they want to buy next.

## What's the goal?

The goal will be to create a web app. I will also present the value of such an app though a slideshow and data visualizations.

## What are your data sources?

1. All of the data will come from BoardGameGeek.com. It will be divided into two main buckets.

2. A sparse matrix of users’ ratings of games Metadata on each of the games in the library.
