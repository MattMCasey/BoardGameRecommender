# Project Proposal 1: Board Game Recommender

### High Level Description:

I will use ratings from more than 100,000 Board Game Geek users to create a board game recommender for Board Game Geek users.

The recommender will use collaborative filtering, clustering and meta-data to recommend games that a user hasn’t yet rated but would likely enjoy.


### What question or problem are you trying to solve?

Board games have become a thriving hobby, and board game companies have responded to the demand. At a recent board game trade show, publishers unveiled more than 400 new games.

With so many titles hitting the shelves each year, it can be difficult for any but the most dedicated gamer to know what game they want to buy next.


### How will you present your work?

The goal will be to create a web app. I will also present the value of such an app though a slideshow and data visualizations.


### What are your data sources?

All of the data will come from BoardGameGeek.com. It will be divided into two main buckets.
  1. A sparse matrix of users’ ratings of games
  2. Metadata on each of the games in the library.

### What’s your next step towards making this your project?

I have already written the code necessary to scrape the data and begun storing the results. The next step is to ramp up these efforts and use virtual machines to download the data at a higher pace.


# Project Proposal 2: Fake News Detector

### High Level Description:

I would use language vectorization to predict the likelihood that a news article would be classified as “fake news” on the basis of whether it fabricates or greatly distorts facts.


### What question or problem are you trying to solve?

The modern age of internet news distribution has made it difficult for news consumers to detect when they’re reading a legitimate piece of reporting, and when they’re reading a piece of fiction created to further an agenda.


### How will you present your work?

The goal will be to create a web app. I will also present the value of such an app though a slideshow and data visualizations.


### What are your data sources?

The data would come from three sources.
  1. The fake news dataset from Kaggle.
  2. A supplemental survey of articles from chosen real and fake sources (New York Times, Breitbart, etc.)
  3. The ultimate input articles, which could come from any news site on the internet.


### What’s your next step towards making this your project?

I have already downloaded many examples. The next steps would be to round out the corpus and build the model.



# Project Proposal 3: 311 Home Value Predictor

### High Level Description:

I would build a model that aims to find novel leading indicators of real estate prices from the volume and type of 311 calls placed from that zip code in the preceding years.


 ### What question or problem are you trying to solve?

How to buy property in NYC that’s likely to appreciate in value in the near future.


### How will you present your work?

I would present my work primarily as a slideshow with accompanying data visualizations.


### What are your data sources?

The data would come from two sources:
  1. NYC.gov’s open data portal.
  2. Zillow’s python API.

### What’s your next step towards making this your project?

Acquiring the data from each of these sources is trivial. The real next step would be to integrate the data.
