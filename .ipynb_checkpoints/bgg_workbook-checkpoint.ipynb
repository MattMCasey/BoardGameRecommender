If you managed to collect some White Dwarfs GW made some additional characters and Traps/Monsters/Treasure cards (I forgot which issues). For a 22 Dollar investment (then) it has replayablity and makes for an enjoyable evening with the friends. I even managed to get the wife interested in this one, but with some people they take it personally when you wack their character with a nasty monster or trap.

Not an award-winner by any means, but colorful and entertaining in a silly kind of way.  Needs to be played quickly with either eerie or exciting music in the background, and an imposing voice to read the encounter descriptions.  Great to bring out for new players; the 3D pyramid is pretty cool, and the hieroglyphics on the support tower really are funny to loook at!  Nice to have in the collection.\"></comment>\n",

The game was on the back of the successful Fury of Dracula game released by GW and Stephen Hand..

If you managed to collect some White Dwarfs GW made some additional characters and Traps/Monsters/Treasure cards (I forgot which issues). For a 22 Dollar investment (then) it has replayablity and makes for an enjoyable evening with the friends. I even managed to get the wife interested in this one, but with some people they take it personally when you wack their character with a nasty monster or trap.
